BBCODE library is intended to help developers whose intention is to support bbcodes in their 
C++ web projects. The library implements BBCODE compiler that allows it to handle bb codes 
with accuracy that only grammar can provide. The built-in XSS prevention mechanics guarantees that 
no javascript is ever inserted through supported bbcodes.

Key features:

  * full bbcode support
  * built-in bbcode compiler
  * HTML friendly - bbcodelib guarantees that no tag is left unclosed or overlapped
  * includes XSS filtering mechanics
  * speed and reliability
  * supports custom bbcode schemas
  * portable, bbcodelib is using nothing but STL and works at least under LINUX and WIN32
